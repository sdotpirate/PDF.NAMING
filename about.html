            <li><strong>View or Share</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>View PDF</strong>: Use the "View PDF" button to open the PDF in another tab, whether on mobile or desktop. The resulting file will follow the file naming structure (custom or default) no matter the platform.</li>

                            <li>On <strong>mobile devices</strong>, you can share the PDF via email, messaging, cloud storage, and social media using the native share options on iOS and Android.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Click Efficiency</h2>
        <h3>Designed for Minimal Clicks</h3>
        <p>PIX to PDF is engineered for maximum efficiency, allowing you to convert and share images with minimal clicks. This design ensures a faster, more streamlined process, saving you time and reducing frustration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One-Tap Conversion</strong>: Convert images to PDF with a single tap.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Sharing</strong>: Share your PDFs directly from the app without navigating through multiple menus.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Better than the Alternatives</h2>
        <p>We understand that there are many apps that offer similar functionality, but they often suffer from being bloated and inefficient. Here’s why PIX to PDF is a superior choice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Unnecessary Features</strong>: Unlike other apps that are cluttered with features you don’t need, PIX to PDF focuses on what’s important – quick and easy image-to-PDF conversion.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Workflow</strong>: Our app’s streamlined design means fewer clicks and faster results. You won’t waste time navigating complex menus or dealing with unnecessary options.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>A Better Alternative to Uploading Individual Images</h2>
        <p>PIX to PDF offers a superior alternative to uploading individual images to cloud services or email. Managing multiple image files can be cumbersome:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Naming</strong>: Naming each file individually is time-consuming and prone to errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization</strong>: Even if files are named, it can be difficult to locate the specific image you need.</li>
            <li><strong>File Management</strong>: Rotating, organizing, and sharing multiple files individually is inefficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With PIX to PDF, you can consolidate all your images into a single PDF file. This makes it much easier to manage, share, and store your documents. A single PDF is easier to find, review, and distribute, streamlining your workflow and saving you time.</p>

        <h2>Handling Large Documents</h2>
        <p>PIX to PDF is capable of handling large documents, having been tested successfully with up to 99 pages. This scalability makes it suitable for both small and extensive documentation tasks, ensuring you have the flexibility to manage any project size.</p>

        <h2>Global Accessibility</h2>
        <p>We believe in making our app accessible to everyone. PIX to PDF includes automatic front-end translations for many global languages. The app automatically detects and sets the language based on your device's language preference, with no user interaction needed. This ensures a convenient and easy-to-use experience for users around the world.</p>

        <h2>Compression Method</h2>
        <p>To optimize file size and ensure quick sharing, PIX to PDF employs light compression. This approach balances image quality and file size, making your documents easy to share via email, messaging, and other platforms while preserving visual clarity. Smaller file sizes also save storage space on your device, allowing you to store more documents without sacrificing too much capacity.</p>
